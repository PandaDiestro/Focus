Focus is a browser extension developed mainly for chromium-based interfaces like ms edge or chrome, but should work in any browser (modifying the manifest) since it only uses native javascript and html.

It works deleting the whole body element of the webpages which url contains one of the keywords at the "focusarray" at app.js so if you want to add or delete more keywords you only have to change that array.

Its still on development so if you have any bug or issue be sure to tell me :D

_---------- known issues: ---------_
<ol>
  <li>Overloading at "reddit.com" but not at subreddits</li>
  <li>The head icon doesnt show at certain pages, eg. discord, twitter, etc</li>
  <li>There is not a "rest button" so the only way to stop the extension is from the extension panel of your browser.</li>
</ol>
