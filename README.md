# Focus
Browser extension that deletes the body of websites that can be a distraction, like discord, facebook, etc.

To add more keywords which you would like to delete too, go to "app.js" and modify the array "focusarray" of website keywords at the top.

<ol>
  <li>Overloading at "reddit.com" but not at subreddits</li>
